# MS-lesion-segmentation
This project performs MS lesion segmentation depending on state of the art networks such as SegNet and SkipdeconvNet. The aim of the pproject is to compare between these two networks in segmenting the lesions and see which one has better perfomance in this scope.
The data from the MSSEG 2008 challenge will serve as a training, validation and testing set.
